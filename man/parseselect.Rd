\description{
Parse the keep/remove/extract/exclude/chr options
}
\details{
\code{keep}, \code{remove} could take one of three 
formats: (1) A logical vector indicating which indivduals to keep/remove, 
(2) A \code{data.frame} with two columns giving the FID and IID of the indivdiuals
to keep/remove (matching those in the .fam file), or (3) a character scalar giving 
the text file with the FID/IID. Note that these files should have no headers. 
Likewise \code{extract}, \code{exclude} can also take one of the three formats,
except with the role of the FID/IID data.frame replaced with a character vector of 
SNP ids (matching those in the .bim file).
